## **Lesson Plan: Comprehensive Introduction to CSS**

### **Learning Objectives**
By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
1. Understand the purpose and scope of CSS.
2. Utilize a wide range of CSS selectors, properties, and values to style web pages.
3. Link CSS to HTML using inline, internal, and external stylesheets.
4. Apply advanced CSS concepts such as the box model, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, flexbox, grid, and media queries.
5. Build a fully responsive webpage using CSS, including layout techniques and animations.

### **1. What is CSS?**
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: CSS is the language used to describe the style of HTML documents. It handles the look and formatting of a website, allowing you to control colors, fonts, layouts, and responsiveness.
- **Cascading**: The word "cascading" means that the order of the style rules matters, allowing inheritance and overriding properties based on specificity and importance.

### **2. CSS Syntax and Structure**

- **Selectors**: Determine which HTML elements are styled.
- **Properties**: Define which aspect of the element is styled.
- **Values**: Specify how the properties are styled.

**Example:**
```css
selector {
    property: value;
}
```

Example of basic CSS:
```css
p {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 16px;
}
```

### **3. CSS Selectors (Basic and Advanced)**

Selectors define how you target elements for styling. CSS provides a range of selectors, from simple to advanced.

#### **Basic Selectors**
1. **Element Selector**: Targets all instances of an HTML element.
   ```css
   p {
       color: black;
   }
   ```

2. **Class Selector**: Targets elements with a specific class attribute.
   ```css
   .example {
       font-size: 14px;
   }
   ```

3. **ID Selector**: Targets a single element with a unique ID.
   ```css
   #header {
       background-color: lightblue;
   }
   ```

4. **Universal Selector**: Applies to all elements.
   ```css
   * {
       margin: 0;
       padding: 0;
   }
   ```

#### **Advanced Selectors**
1. **Descendant Selector**: Targets elements that are inside a specified element.
   ```css
   div p {
       color: green;
   }
   ```

2. **Child Selector**: Targets immediate children of an element.
   ```css
   ul > li {
       list-style-type: square;
   }
   ```

3. **Attribute Selector**: Targets elements with specific attributes.
   ```css
   input[type="text"] {
       border: 1px solid #000;
   }
   ```

4. **Pseudo-Class Selector**: Targets elements based on their state.
   ```css
   a:hover {
       color: red;
   }
   ```

5. **Pseudo-Element Selector**: Styles a specific part of an element, such as the first line or first letter.
   ```css
   p::first-line {
       font-weight: bold;
   }
   ```

### **4. CSS Properties and Values**

CSS provides a wide range of properties to control the appearance of web pages.

#### **Typography**
- **Color**: Changes the text color.
   ```css
   p {
       color: navy;
   }
   ```

- **Font Size**: Defines the size of the text.
   ```css
   h1 {
       font-size: 36px;
   }
   ```

- **Font Weight**: Specifies the boldness of the text.
   ```css
   p {
       font-weight: bold;
   }
   ```

#### **Layout and Positioning**
- **Margin**: Creates space outside the element’s border.
   ```css
   div {
       margin: 20px;
   }
   ```

- **Padding**: Creates space inside the element’s border.
   ```css
   div {
       padding: 10px;
   }
   ```

- **Display**: Controls how an element is displayed (block, inline, etc.).
   ```css
   div {
       display: flex;
   }
   ```

- **Position**: Specifies the positioning method (static, relative, absolute, fixed).
   ```css
   div {
       position: relative;
       top: 10px;
   }
   ```

### **5. Linking CSS to HTML**

There are three ways to link CSS to an HTML document:

#### **1. Inline CSS**:
Styles are added directly within an HTML tag. This is generally discouraged for maintainability.
```html
<p style="color: red;">This is red text.</p>
```

#### **2. Internal CSS**:
CSS is placed within the `<style>` element in the `<head>` section of the HTML document.
```html
<style>
    p {
        color: green;
    }
</style>
```

#### **3. External CSS**:
The best practice is to use external stylesheets to separate design and structure. You link an external `.css` file using the `<link>` tag.
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```

Example HTML linking an external CSS file:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Webpage</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph styled with external CSS.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
