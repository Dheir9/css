## **Lesson Plan: Comprehensive Introduction to CSS**

### **Learning Objectives**
By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
1. Understand the purpose and scope of CSS.
2. Utilize a wide range of CSS selectors, properties, and values to style web pages.
3. Link CSS to HTML using inline, internal, and external stylesheets.
4. Apply advanced CSS concepts such as the box model, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, flexbox, grid, and media queries.
5. Build a fully responsive webpage using CSS, including layout techniques and animations.

### **1. What is CSS?**
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: CSS is the language used to describe the style of HTML documents. It handles the look and formatting of a website, allowing you to control colors, fonts, layouts, and responsiveness.
- **Cascading**: The word "cascading" means that the order of the style rules matters, allowing inheritance and overriding properties based on specificity and importance.

---

### **2. CSS Syntax and Structure**

- **Selectors**: Determine which HTML elements are styled.
- **Properties**: Define which aspect of the element is styled.
- **Values**: Specify how the properties are styled.

**Example:**
```css
selector {
    property: value;
}
```

Example of basic CSS:
```css
p {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 16px;
}
```

### **3. CSS Selectors (Basic and Advanced)**

Selectors define how you target elements for styling. CSS provides a range of selectors, from simple to advanced.

#### **Basic Selectors**
1. **Element Selector**: Targets all instances of an HTML element.
   ```css
   p {
       color: black;
   }
   ```

2. **Class Selector**: Targets elements with a specific class attribute.
   ```css
   .example {
       font-size: 14px;
   }
   ```

3. **ID Selector**: Targets a single element with a unique ID.
   ```css
   #header {
       background-color: lightblue;
   }
   ```

4. **Universal Selector**: Applies to all elements.
   ```css
   * {
       margin: 0;
       padding: 0;
   }
   ```

#### **Advanced Selectors**
1. **Descendant Selector**: Targets elements that are inside a specified element.
   ```css
   div p {
       color: green;
   }
   ```

2. **Child Selector**: Targets immediate children of an element.
   ```css
   ul > li {
       list-style-type: square;
   }
   ```

3. **Attribute Selector**: Targets elements with specific attributes.
   ```css
   input[type="text"] {
       border: 1px solid #000;
   }
   ```

4. **Pseudo-Class Selector**: Targets elements based on their state.
   ```css
   a:hover {
       color: red;
   }
   ```

5. **Pseudo-Element Selector**: Styles a specific part of an element, such as the first line or first letter.
   ```css
   p::first-line {
       font-weight: bold;
   }
   ```

### **4. CSS Properties and Values**

CSS provides a wide range of properties to control the appearance of web pages.

#### **Typography**
- **Color**: Changes the text color.
   ```css
   p {
       color: navy;
   }
   ```

- **Font Size**: Defines the size of the text.
   ```css
   h1 {
       font-size: 36px;
   }
   ```

- **Font Weight**: Specifies the boldness of the text.
   ```css
   p {
       font-weight: bold;
   }
   ```

#### **Layout and Positioning**
- **Margin**: Creates space outside the element’s border.
   ```css
   div {
       margin: 20px;
   }
   ```

- **Padding**: Creates space inside the element’s border.
   ```css
   div {
       padding: 10px;
   }
   ```

- **Display**: Controls how an element is displayed (block, inline, etc.).
   ```css
   div {
       display: flex;
   }
   ```

- **Position**: Specifies the positioning method (static, relative, absolute, fixed).
   ```css
   div {
       position: relative;
       top: 10px;
   }
   ```

### **5. Linking CSS to HTML**

There are three ways to link CSS to an HTML document:

#### **1. Inline CSS**:
Styles are added directly within an HTML tag. This is generally discouraged for maintainability.
```html
<p style="color: red;">This is red text.</p>
```

#### **2. Internal CSS**:
CSS is placed within the `<style>` element in the `<head>` section of the HTML document.
```html
<style>
    p {
        color: green;
    }
</style>
```

#### **3. External CSS**:
The best practice is to use external stylesheets to separate design and structure. You link an external `.css` file using the `<link>` tag.
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```

Example HTML linking an external CSS file:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Webpage</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph styled with external CSS.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**Specificity** in CSS is a set of rules that determines which CSS styles are applied to an element when multiple conflicting rules target the same element. When more than one rule applies to the same element, **specificity** decides which one will take precedence.

### **How Specificity Works**

Specificity is calculated based on the type of selectors used in the rule. CSS assigns different weights to different kinds of selectors. The more specific a selector is, the higher its specificity value, and the more likely it is to override other rules.

### **Understanding Specificity Values**

CSS specificity is usually represented in a 4-part value, often written as `(a, b, c, d)`, where each letter represents a different type of selector. Let’s break it down:

1. **a (ID selectors)**: The number of `#id` selectors in the rule.
2. **b (Class selectors, attribute selectors, pseudo-classes)**: The number of `.class`, `[attribute]`, or `:pseudo-class` selectors.
3. **c (Type selectors, pseudo-elements)**: The number of element type selectors (e.g., `div`, `p`, `h1`) and pseudo-elements (e.g., `::before`, `::after`).
4. **d (Inline styles)**: The presence of inline styles, added directly to an element with the `style` attribute, has the highest specificity.

When two or more CSS rules target the same element, the rule with the highest specificity is applied. If two rules have the same specificity, the **last one in the code** takes precedence.

### **Specificity Calculation Example**

Let’s consider a few examples to calculate specificity:

```css
/* Example 1: Simple element selector */
p {
    color: blue;
}
```
- Specificity: `(0, 0, 1, 0)`
  - There is 1 element selector (`p`), no ID, no class, and no inline styles.

```css
/* Example 2: Class selector */
p.example {
    color: red;
}
```
- Specificity: `(0, 1, 1, 0)`
  - There is 1 element selector (`p`) and 1 class selector (`.example`).

```css
/* Example 3: ID selector */
#main {
    color: green;
}
```
- Specificity: `(1, 0, 0, 0)`
  - There is 1 ID selector (`#main`), no class, and no element selectors.

```css
/* Example 4: Inline style */
<p style="color: yellow;">
```
- Specificity: `(1, 0, 0, 0)`
  - Inline styles always have the highest specificity.

### **Hierarchy of Selectors (from Least to Most Specific)**

1. **Element (Type) Selector**: Low specificity. Matches elements by their tag name.
   - Example: `div`, `p`, `h1`
   - Specificity: `(0, 0, 1, 0)`

2. **Class Selector**: More specific than an element selector. Matches elements with a class attribute.
   - Example: `.container`, `.example`
   - Specificity: `(0, 1, 0, 0)`

3. **ID Selector**: Highly specific. Matches elements with a specific ID attribute.
   - Example: `#main`, `#header`
   - Specificity: `(1, 0, 0, 0)`

4. **Inline Styles**: Styles applied directly to an element in the HTML via the `style` attribute.
   - Example: `<p style="color: yellow;">`
   - Specificity: `(1, 0, 0, 0)`

### **Specificity Examples in Practice**

Let’s look at how specificity works in practice:

```html
<p id="intro" class="text">Hello World!</p>
```

```css
/* Example CSS */
p {
    color: blue; /* Specificity: (0, 0, 1, 0) */
}

.text {
    color: red; /* Specificity: (0, 1, 0, 0) */
}

#intro {
    color: green; /* Specificity: (1, 0, 0, 0) */
}

p#intro {
    color: yellow; /* Specificity: (1, 0, 1, 0) */
}

p {
    color: black !important; /* Overrides other rules due to !important */
}
```

1. **First Rule** (`p { color: blue; }`):
   - This is an element selector, so the specificity is `(0, 0, 1, 0)`.
   
2. **Second Rule** (`.text { color: red; }`):
   - This is a class selector, so the specificity is `(0, 1, 0, 0)`. It’s more specific than the first rule, so the paragraph’s color would become **red**.

3. **Third Rule** (`#intro { color: green; }`):
   - This is an ID selector, so the specificity is `(1, 0, 0, 0)`. It is more specific than the class or element selectors, so the paragraph’s color would become **green**.

4. **Fourth Rule** (`p#intro { color: yellow; }`):
   - This is a combination of an element selector and an ID selector, giving it a specificity of `(1,
